# Smart-Doorbell
This project aimed to create a home monitoring system that also acts as a doorbell and can be accessed and monitored from anywhere in the world from a Raspberry Pi. We would use a combination of components from labs in class and other web services to make a product similar to a Ring Doorbell. The key components and web services it will use consist of a push switch, camera, ultrasonic ranging detector, speakers, resistors, Discord, discord.py from a GitHub repository, Discord Developer Portal, and wires. Essentially, whenever the doorbell detects motion or is rung, it will notify the owner, wherever they are in the world, via a Discord bot. If the doorbell is rung, it will also play a doorbell sound effect through the speakers. The final product succeeded in all of these goals. It successfully monitors for motion and pressing of the doorbell simultaneously while appropriately notifying the homeowner when an event occurs at their door.
